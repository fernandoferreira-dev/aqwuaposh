# Oh My Posh – Tonybaloney (Personal Version)

This is my personal version of the **tonybaloney** theme for **oh-my-posh**.

It’s not a redesign or a creative fork — just the original theme with **small visual tweaks**, while keeping the structure and behavior (especially the Git segment) exactly the same as the original.

## What’s different

- Minor color adjustments
- Small visual tweaks
- Original layout preserved
- **Git segment unchanged** (same behavior and information as the original theme)

## Requirements

- [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- A **Nerd Font** (required), for example:
  - JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
  - FiraCode Nerd Font
  - Hack Nerd Font

Without a Nerd Font, icons will not render correctly.

## Usage

1. Copy the `.omp.json` file to your machine
2. Configure your shell to use this theme file
3. Reload oh-my-posh:

```bash
oh-my-posh reload
```
